            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="opportunity-card">
                <p>The internship orientation session was conducted by OCS sometime around 15th June and the CV deadline was 22nd June and extended to 26th (Maybe dates are a bit here and there but roughly this was the timeline).</p>
                <p>Some things which are important for (Quant/Tech) CV are your JEE Advanced Rank, Olympiad Achievements, CGPA, Department Rank, participation in Quant Programs like SEE, Futurefocus, Launchpad etcetera, Foreign Research Internship, Projects (Course projects and self projects).</p>
                <p>Participation in Quant Programs holds a lot of importance and might help a lot in getting a CV shortlist for Quant companies.</p>
                <p>Then, the company's Job Description files started getting uploaded on the portal and we could apply to them (there was a deadline). The JD files included the stipend, number of rounds (although this is not at all followed by most companies), skills required (same here) and expected number of hires (again the same).</p>
                <p>The deadline for applications for companies varied a lot with some companies giving 2 weeks to apply while others giving just 2 days.</p>
                <p>The key thing is that you can apply to at most 50 companies. So use your applications wisely and don’t apply blindly to all the companies. Although 50 seems a lot, applications can get used up pretty quickly.</p>
                <p>Then, the PPT’s and tests started from 15th July. In PPT’s companies mostly try to sell themselves to the students and tell students about themselves. Some PPT’s are actually useful in the sense that you get to know about the number of rounds, what will be actually asked in the interviews and GD’s etcetera but mostly I found them to be not very useful.</p>
                <p>The main part of the process is the tests. Tests can be coding tests of 1 hour or 2 hours or can be a mix of coding and some maths problems or can be only maths problems. The duration and format varies for every company.</p>
                <p>The coding part of the tests mainly includes DSA / CP problems. The level of the tests vary a lot from company to company although I found most tests to be quite doable with a good amount of CP/DSA prep. Hardly 5-6 companies had very hard coding tests. Tests included problems mainly from topics like strings, arrays, graphs, trees, dynamic programming and of course ad hoc problems.</p>
                <p>The maths parts of the tests mainly includes Olympiad style maths (the style is not exactly olympiad but rather a mix of olympiad and JEE style maths). The main topics in the maths tests were combinatorics, probability, number theory and brain teasers. I found the standard Quant interview prep of solving probability puzzles and brainteasers to not be very helpful for the tests. Few tests had puzzles but they were mostly very standard Xingfeng/Brainstellar puzzles.</p>

                    <p>71 min test for Trader/Researcher/Market Risk and 95 min test for Software.  Open for CS, MT, EE, PH, ME and 8.4 CG Criteria. The trading test included a 26 min guess the sequence test with 25 questions and a 45 minute probability test with 30 questions. The sequence test was pretty easy but the probability test was very hard. Each question had a dedicated time of 90 seconds and there was +1,-1 negative marking. The questions were based on estimation and not a part of standard quant prep. The Software test was a 75 minute coding test and also a 20 min MCQ Test. The 75 minute coding test had only 1 question which was based on DSA and OOPS. The 20 minute MCQ test included all kinds of CS concepts like OS, CN, DSA, and some random stuff.</p>
                    <p>GD was the same for both roles. It was a question based on converting types of fruits to each other with some cost.</p>

The first part was a Hackerrank test with one coding question and 20 other questions based on probability, brainteasers and sequence guessing, this was for 75 min. The second part was a40 min brain reaction time measuring test conducted on the Neurolympics platform. No real preparation can be done for that.

The first test had 3 parts. 50 minutes for Math problems based on probability and number theory. 60 minutes for 3 very hard CP problems. 10 minutes for 5 C++ questions based on Memory alignment and padding and virtual functions. Shortlisting criteria for the second test was CS, MT 9+ CG and EE I think 9.3+ CG though not sure, but most likely test 1 performance was not accounted for. Test 2 was a completely subjective 1.5 hour pen paper based test. Two Hard Math problems based on Integration and Number theory, they were proof based. Two Hard CP problems based on Number Theory and DP. One problem based on systems/C++ concepts. Again it was a common test.</p>

            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <div class="opportunity-card">
                <p>I personally found the internship season to be very hectic and chaotic. 3-4 tests were being conducted during the day with some tests ending at 1:00 am and others starting at 6:00 am. Most people missed classes for the first 2.5 weeks. From what I observed, the internship season is based a lot on luck and past achievements. JEE Advanced ranks and high CGPA (9.5+) matters a lot and makes getting shortlists much easier. The shortlists (as you might have read) were mostly based on very good JEE Advance ranks, Department ranks and a lot of luck.</p>
                <p>I also observed that GD preparation is often neglected. Ability to think fast and solve probability questions / brainteasers and speaking out is important for GD’s. In the Quant programs held by companies, a lot of trading and market making games are played and those are quite important for GD’s.</p>
                <p>Some people had very good luck and got a lot of shortlists but others got very few. I think that Patience and Resilience are the things required to cope with this time and I would strongly suggest people to build up on these qualities since not getting shortlists due to bad luck can be extremely demotivating and have a very negative impact on your mental health. Apart from that, being aware of what all is going on, which company asked which types of questions is helpful since often a lot of questions get repeated. Keeping calm is also a very important quality to have. For getting interview specific guidance, I would suggest contacting seniors who have got internships in the respective companies. A lot of company specific insight can also be gained by reading blogs of other colleges like IIT Kharagpur and on other websites. Start preparing early, keep your morale high and develop qualities like patience and resilience.</p>
